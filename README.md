# TicTacToe
This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports two-player gameplay, allowing users to play alternately with X and O while the game automatically detects win and draw conditions.  The project focuses on JavaScript logic building, DOM manipulation, and creating an interactive user experience.
